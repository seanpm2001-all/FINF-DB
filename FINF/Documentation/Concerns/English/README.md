# Project concerns

I have some concerns regarding this project, they include:

**Database size:** I am worried that this database may not fit in 100 gigabytes of space, and I don't know how to split it up. There are over 1 million file extensions to document, each file extension has an HTML document that can be up to 50 kilobytes in size, along with images of the file icons across several desktop environments. Lets round it up to 500 kilobytes per extension (100 GB = 200000), and lets put 10000 kilobytes (10 megabytes, -20 entries) for the rest of the project. I would only be able to fit ~199980 file extensions in a 100 gigabyte project.

**Maintainability:** This project will be very difficult to maintain. I will need some dedicated maintainers once development starts rolling.

_No other concerns at the moment._
