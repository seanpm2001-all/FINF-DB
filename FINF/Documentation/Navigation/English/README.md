# Navigation

[Language list unavailable](/FINF/Documentation/FilePath/)

This project is very difficult to navigate by hand. For search functions, it is recommended to search for the file with the string `aboutfile.` followed by the file you are looking for. It would be far too tedious to do it through a directory by directory search. A list should also be kept and ALWAYS updated.
